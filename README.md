RobotQuest
==========

<a href="http://github.com/seanhess/robotquest "><img src="https://raw.github.com/seanhess/robotquest/master/public/screen.png"></a>

RobotQuest is a MMO, programming game. Instead of playing RobotQuest directly, you write a program that plays it for you. Your program communicates with the [game server API](#api) over HTTP by sending and receiving JSON messages.

All players share a single world

~~[The Viewer][viewer] lets you watch the game being played live.~~

[The Documentation](#documentation) will teach you how to connect to the game and control your minions.

[The Source](http://github.com/seanhess/robotquest) is here on github

Also see [Status](#status). I don't have plans to continue development. Fork and reuse at will. 

What can I do?
--------------

You can create minions (heroes or monsters), move them, and attack things near you. There is an AI player that spawns minions of increasing degrees of danger to give you trouble.

What's the goal?
----------------

You can see who has the most kills and has survived the longest on the [Viewer][viewer]. Other than that it's up to the players. The game will change signifiantly depending on the programs written for it and as new features are added.

Rules
-----

Please respect the following rules. The server will eventually enforce them.

1. **Spawn with purpose** - The API allows you to spawn multiple minions per player. Explore getting minions to work together, but don't spawn one on every square or anything. Consider having internal rules, like you can only spawn a minion when you kill one.

2. **Single player per program**- You can try many different approaches to the game, but idea is that you write a program, which is a player. If you want to try a different approach, feel free to turn your old program off and use the same player name, or use a different player name, but don't spam player accounts

Feature Ideas
-------------

* Blocks - Place walls down on the map that block movement
* Gold -  Collect gold
* Store - Spend gold to buy items (upgrades)
* Trading - Swap gold or items with other minions
* Big World - Infinite or much larger world. Safe zones?
* Limit Player Creation - right now it's completely open
* Limit Spawning - make it a resource of some kind

Technical Details
-----------------

The application was written in Haskell (ghc 7.2+), with the [Scotty Web Framework](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/scotty-0.0.1), [mongodb](http://www.mongodb.org/), some HTML and of course, JSON. 

When players issue a command, it saves those on their minion object. A game timer fires once a second, grabbing all the commands and resolving them in haskell before saving out all the changes at once. 

I'll write more detailed articles soon on http://seanhess.github.com. Specifically, I'd like to address the difficulties of developing a web app in haskell.

To run locally

1. install haskell platform 2012
2. `cabal install cabal-dev`
3. `cabal-dev install` within the directory

Status
------

I don't know if I'll continue work on this. See [Feature Ideas](#feature-ideas) for where I was planning on going next. 

The server is not really production ready. Too many bots will make it drag down. It keeps breaking.

Please fork and do whatever you want with it.

Notes
-----

All routes are relative to the root domain: http://robotquest.tk

    curl -X GET http://robotquest.tk/game/info

All types sent and received from the server are in JSON. Don't forget to set "Content-Type: application/json" and Content-Length (good libraries will do this for you)

This includes the [Id](#id) type, which is just a JSON string. Run everything through your JSON parser and all will be well

Supports CORS: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. You should be able to hit the API from another domain even from a browser. 

Examples
--------

Here are three complete examples:

* [AI (CoffeeScript)](https://github.com/seanhess/robotquest/blob/master/ai/app.coffee)
* [Scarab (JS)](https://github.com/Rob-ot/Rob-bot)
* [Zombies (PHP)](https://github.com/FrizbeeFanatic14/RoroUiraArii)

The following examples are in psuedocode

### Control a minion

    # register our player
    player = {name:"example", source: "http://github.com/seanhess/robotquest"}
    player.id = POST "/players" player

    # spawn a minion
    minion = {x: 0, y: 5, name:"example1", sprite: "dragon-1-3"}
    minion.id = POST "/players/$player.id/minions" minion

    # move our minion
    POST "/minions/$player.id/minions/$minion.id" {action: "Move", direction: "Right"} 

    # remove our minion
    DELETE "/minions/$player.id/minions/$minion.id"

### See what is going on

    game = GET "/game/info"
    repeatEvery game.tick 
      objects = GET "/game/objects"
      for minion in objects
        print minion


Types
-----

### Fault

    { message: "Space occupied" }

Any method can return a <code>Fault</code> instead of its regular response.

### Ok

    "Ok"

### Id

    "6dc21b03a79fa15d"
    
Note that this will include quotes when it comes down. This is valid JSON. Just run it through your normal JSON decoder and it will come out a string

### GameInfo

    {
        width: 25,
        height: 20,
        tick: 1000
    }

`tick` - Game tick in ms. How often you can send commands and poll for information

<code>width, height</code> - World dimensions in squares

### Player

    {
        name: "sean",
        source: "http://github.com/seanhess/robotquest"
    }

<code>name</code> - A unique player name for your program.
<code>source</code> - Bot homepage. Source code preferred.

### Minion

    // To Server
    {
      name: "rat",
      sprite: "monster1-1-4",
      x: 10,
      y: 10
    }
      
    // From Server
    {
      name: "rat",
      sprite: "monster1-1-4",
      x: 10
      y: 10,

<h2 id="sprites">Sprites</h2>

I am using the extraordinarily complete, free, <a href="http://pousse.rapiere.free.fr/tome/tome-tiles.htm">angbandtk dungeon tileset</a>. When creating a minion, you can choose the sprite that represents it. The format is:

  <pre>sheet-x-y</pre>

where <code>sheet</code> is the name of one of the following sheets, and <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are the 0-indexed offset from the top left. For example, the dark blue ghost is <code>undead-0-0</code>, while the phoenix is <code>uniques-8-5</code>
